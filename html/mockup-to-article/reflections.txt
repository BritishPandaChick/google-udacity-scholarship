**What new skills have you learned?**
A lot of the skills in these past few lessons have been a review of HTML. I've
done a lot of work with HTML already so I understand HTML works as well as most
of the HTML tags (i.e. headlines, paragraph tags). I did learn about new HTML tags
such as <sup> and <strike> tags.

**What has been easy?**
Most of the content was easy. Again I've worked with HTML before so I have experience
headline tags, paragraph tags, images, links, etc. The quizzes and projects have been very
easy as well.

**What has been difficult?**
I made a couple of errors in some of the quizzes, but I was able to spot the errors rather quickly.
The only thing that has been difficult is trying to exactly recreate mock ups. I am a perfectionist so
I was nitpicking my site with the sample image showing the final result.
